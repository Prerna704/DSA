---------Bubble Sort-------

Simple comparison-based algorithm

Compares adjacent elements

Largest element “bubbles” to the end in each pass

Time Complexity: Worst & Average O(n²), Best O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) → in-place

Stable sorting

Best for small or nearly sorted arrays

------------Selection Sort----------------

Finds the smallest element in each iteration and swaps it to the correct position

Comparisons are many, swaps are few

Time Complexity: O(n²) in all cases

Space Complexity: O(1) → in-place

Unstable sorting

Best when minimizing swaps is important

-----------------Insertion Sort---------------------

Divides array into sorted + unsorted parts

Inserts each element into the correct position in the sorted part

Time Complexity: Worst & Average O(n²), Best O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) → in-place

Stable sorting

Best for small or nearly sorted data, also useful for online insertion

Stable: Equal elements keep their original order

Unstable: Equal elements may change order after sorting
